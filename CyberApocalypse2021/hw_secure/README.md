### SECURE

#### Write UP

- I don't remember the complete solution.
- We first used 'Logic' program to analyze the .sal file.
- Next, using the data we find there, we get some bytes which start from CHTB.
- So, we try to decode them, only hint was that these bytes may contain errors of a few bits
- So, after many logical guesses, we found the string.
